## Workshop: Python + VPS Jupyter HUB/Notebook, learn, teach, research, work collaboratively, remotely and in face-to-face.

* **Date and place**: 30 April 2022. [PyConUS 2022 Salt Lake City, Utah, United States](https://us.pycon.org/2022)
* **Link to presentation:** https://us.pycon.org/2022/schedule/presentation/10/
* **Video to presentation:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sq4t8HfIPec&list=PL2Uw4_HvXqvYeXy8ab7iRHjA-9HiYhRQl&index=95
* **Level**: Level: beginners and up  
* **Context**: Remote, on-line and in face to face
* **Speakers**: [Sofía Martin](https://github.com/entrerrianas), [Ariel Ramos](https://us.pycon.org/2022/speaker/profile/11/), [Liliana Hurtado](https://us.pycon.org/2022/speaker/profile/185/), [Enzo Juarez](https://github.com/enzzo19/)
* **Description (Summary):** 

  - Since 2017 in the Argentina North, we carry out activities with experiences in technology with positive impact on society, we do it with the Communities [Python Norte] (https://t.me/pythonnorte) and [Python Argentina] (HTTPS: //www.python.org.ar/). We teach attendees good practices of use of technology and Open Source Software.<br>
  - We are based on the talk by **[Damián Avila](https://github.com/damianavila)** https://2019.scipy.lat/charlas/la-revolucion-de-jupyter/, so...
  - We combined 3 components to achieve a safe and practical technology environment in these remote educational pilot experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br><br>
**The 3 components:**
<br><br>
Programming Language + Work Environment + Infrastructure == **Python + Project Jupyter + VPS (Jupyter HUB/Notebook)**
<br><br>
**VPS** == Virtual Private Server
<br><br>
  - We took into account the basic technical knowledge of the interested parties, so we decided to implement/install on a VPS all the necessary components (Python + Libraries + Jupyter Plugins + Widgets), so they learn directly.<br>
  - We started with programming, then with pilot experiences programming Jupyters Notebooks to teach Mathematics, Physics, Robotics, we built the notebooks with basic programming concepts, helping us with Widgets and Graphics.<br>
  - As we move forward, we put together Jupyter Notebooks for subject content, in addition to those that include mathematical calculations.<br>
  - We achieved a good practice and dynamics in the learning assistance in the use of the VPS and the teaching of concepts of subjects in which we were able to assemble/program Jupyter Notebooks.<br>
  - The interested parties were teachers, students and private individuals.<br>
  - It was done remotely, but we also had face-to-face experiences.<br>
  - We generate our notebooks as resources.<br>
  - It was possible to train Young Researchers from La Universidad Nacional de Salta in disciplines not related to Technology.<br>
  - Notebooks of developed examples: https://github.com/entrerrianas/pyconus2022
  - The Faculty of Computer Science of La Plata (UNLP) has been working with schools of different levels in proposals that allow the incorporation of Computer Science contents through different projects such as the use of [free educational](https://lihuen.linti.unlp.edu.ar/index.php?title=Software_Libre_en_escuelas) applications, [robotics](http://robots.linti.unlp.edu.ar/proyecto) to indicate programming and extension projects for different [levels](https://extension.info.unlp.edu.ar/). From the link that was made from the Python Argentina community, we have linked projects carried out from La Plata with those carried out in Salta. This talk was the result of joint and interdisciplinary work for its adaptation to Secondary School teachers.

**Conclusion Specialist in Didactics:**
* **Proffesor [Liliana Hurtado](https://us.pycon.org/2022/speaker/profile/185/): lilianahur@hotmail.com**
   - In March 2020 and in an educational scenario marked by the global pandemic of COVID 19, I was invited to be part of an innovative team working on teaching and learning in virtual environments.
   - Among the initial objectives, the proposal referred to: The optimization of open source tools that favor the inclusion in educational innovation processes of establishments dedicated to teaching, public and private at all educational levels and the implementation of Python in a VPS with Jupyter HUB/Notebook in different disciplinary fields.
   - My contribution was made from the pedagogical point of view and consisted of making visible the contributions of this proposal in its different ways of questioning the traditional conceptions of teaching and learning, of relationships between teacher and learner, of communicational languages, of evaluation and autonomy.
   - The sandbox was the powerful metaphor to synthesize the transformations and clarify the novelty in the field of teaching and learning mediated by Python and Jupyter HUB/Notebook.
   - Thus, the results were the configuration of a learning environment and condition of possibility for the "powerful teaching" of contents from different disciplinary fields.
   - The basis of this new powerful teaching and learning configuration is nourished by visions and convictions that refer to a transdisciplinary, creative, autonomous and self-regulated, COLLABORATIVE, playful and built in a multi-language matrix, centered on a subject with a desire to learn.
